# BCSD (Bank Check Segmentation Dataset)
Introduced by Khan in [A novel segmentation dataset for signatures on bank checks](https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/bcsd#:~:text=by%20Khan%20in-,A%20novel%20segmentation%20dataset%20for%20signatures%20on%20bank%20checks,-The%20dataset%20consists)

The dataset consists of images of 158 filled out bank checks containing various complex backgrounds, and handwritten text and signatures in the respective fields, along with both pixel-level and patch-level segmentation masks for the signatures on the checks. Please visit the dataset homepage for more details.
